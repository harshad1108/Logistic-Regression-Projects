# 🚨 Fake Job Posting Detection using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent job postings using **Logistic Regression** and text-based features.

## Objectives
- Analyze job posting data
- Perform text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Build a Logistic Regression classifier
- Detect fake vs real job postings

## Dataset
- fake_job_postings.csv

## Techniques Used
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)
- TF-IDF / Count Vectorization
- Logistic Regression Classification

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression in **fraud detection and NLP-based classification**, a highly relevant real-world application.
